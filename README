This contribution contains a rational arithmetic library for Coq. 
This includes:

 * A binary representation for positive rational numbers [Qpositive] and its 
   extension to [Q] by adding sign bit (also known as Stern-Brocot 
   tree encoding).
 * Arithmetic operations on [Qpositive] and [Q] defined in an strict way.
 * More efficient arithmetic operations on [Q] defined lazily using homographic
   and quadratic algorithms for this binary representation (exact rational
   arithmetic).
 * Proof of the correctness of the homographic and quadratic algorithms using
   the strict operations.
 * The files enable the user to use Coq Field tactic on [Q] with two 
   different field structures (using strict or lazy operations).
 * The Haskell extraction of the lazy algorithms (quadratic.hs).  
 * A syntax for using the rational numbers as pair of integers, and writing 
   simple arithmetic operations on them.
 * A proof of irrationality of the square root of 2.
 * A proof that [Q] is Archimedean.
 * A proof that [Q] is denumerable.

 The files are compiled using Coq version 7.4CVS or higher (as they use 
Pierre Courtieu's "Functional Induction" tactic). There is a makefile included. 
In order to compile the files do the following:

$ touch .depend
$ make depend
$ make
